# SSO Integration

Most applications deployed with UDS are automatically integrated with Keycloak. However, two applications do not support install-time 
SSO configuration and so must be configured manually. Those are the Atlassian apps, Jira and Confluence. Please reference the 
Atlassian documentation for guidance in configuring SSO.
