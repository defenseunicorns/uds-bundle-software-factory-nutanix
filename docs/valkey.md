# Configuration Notes

## ValKey Clustering

In bundle version 0.5.2 Valkey was changed to deploy replicated by default. For more context, see [this write-up](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-valkey/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#high-availability) on how Valkey's HA settings are configured in the UDS Package and [the GitLab Package configuration doc]([TODO](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-gitlab/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#valkey-ha-configuration)) to understand the integration with GitLab.
