# Configuration Notes

## ValKey Clustering

In bundle version 0.5.2 Valkey was changed to deploy replicated by default. For more context, see [this write-up](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-valkey/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#high-availability) on Valkey's HA settings as enabled in the UDS Package and [TODO](TODO) on how it is connected to GitLab at the bundle level.
